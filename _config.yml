  Hi,i am Ulas, I currently work as an IT/Tech Recruiter(Consultant) for [sHR. Consultancy] (www.shr-consulting.com). I met with my first computer when i was 7 years old and started basic programming in middle school. Because of my curiosity towards human nature, i decided to major in psychology. Getting exposed to computers/technology years after years and majoring in psychology made me a unique individual with the knowledge of <mark>computer technologies</mark> and <mark>human psychology</mark>.

  With the knowledge of both computer technologies and psychology i can easily understand and relate to software engineers.

  This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

  Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
